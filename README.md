# Game Theory of Life
### Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

## About
Game Theory of Live, is an ode to [Game of Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) with a machine learning twist.

It's clear that the Game of Live succeed on its goals of generating complex patters and emerging self organization, but it doesn't grasp the most intricate aspects of life, such as evolution and free will. It's complicate to say that a being will behave exactly the same over and over, without ever learning what hurts or pleases him.
